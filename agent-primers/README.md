Sessions with an AI Agent often start ignorant and end confused, but there's often a sweet spot in the middle where the agent seems to know what's going on.
At those times I have them generate documentation here so that I can start new sessions by having the agent read the appropriate primer.

The information here **might** be useful to a human, but I haven't taken the time to massage it into the shape that I generally prefer to present to humans.
Sorry.

These ideas are experimental.
I'll document them better if I end up reusing them.
